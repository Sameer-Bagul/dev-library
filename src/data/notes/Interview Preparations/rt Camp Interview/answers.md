# rtCamp Interview Questions & Answers

## JavaScript Fundamentals – Interview Guide with Detailed Explanations

### 1. Is JavaScript single-threaded or multithreaded? Explain the event loop.

**JavaScript is single-threaded** by design, meaning it executes one command at a time in a single call stack. However, it can handle multiple operations seemingly in parallel thanks to its **event loop** and asynchronous APIs.

- **Call Stack**: Where JS executes code line by line.
- **Web APIs**: Browser-provided features (like `setTimeout`, AJAX) handle async tasks outside the main thread.
- **Callback Queue**: When async tasks finish, their callbacks are queued here.
- **Event Loop**: Continuously checks if the call stack is empty; if so, it moves callbacks from the queue to the stack for execution.

This model allows JavaScript to remain responsive, even when waiting for slow operations like network requests.

```js
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
console.log("End");
// Output: Start, End, Timeout
```
Here, `setTimeout` is handled asynchronously, so "End" prints before "Timeout".


### 2. What are IIFEs in JavaScript?

An **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It creates a private scope, preventing variables from leaking into the global scope. This was especially useful before ES6 modules.

```js
(function() {
  console.log("IIFE Running");
})();
```
IIFEs are often used to encapsulate code and avoid polluting the global namespace.


### 3. Explain scope of JavaScript variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)

- `var`: **Function-scoped**. Can be re-declared and updated. Hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.
- `let`: **Block-scoped**. Cannot be re-declared in the same scope. Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ).
- `const`: **Block-scoped**. Must be initialized at declaration and cannot be reassigned.

```js
function test() {
  var a = 1; // function scope
  let b = 2; // block scope
  const c = 3; // block scope, constant
}
```
Understanding scope is crucial for avoiding bugs and unexpected behavior.


### 4. Different types of functions and their uses

- **Function Declaration**: Hoisted, can be called before definition.
  ```js
  function greet() {}
  ```
- **Function Expression**: Not hoisted, assigned to a variable.
  ```js
  const greet = function() {}
  ```
- **Arrow Function**: Shorter syntax, no own `this` or `arguments`.
  ```js
  const greet = () => {}
  ```
- **Constructor Function**: Used with `new` to create objects.
  ```js
  function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
  ```
- **Generator Function**: Can pause and resume execution, useful for iterators.
  ```js
  function* gen() { yield 1; }
  ```


### 5. Differences between normal and arrow functions

- **Arrow functions** do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`.
- Cannot be used as constructors (`new`).
- Useful for callbacks and methods where you want lexical `this`.


### 6. "this" in normal vs arrow functions

- **Normal function**: `this` is dynamic, depends on how the function is called (object method, standalone, etc.).
- **Arrow function**: `this` is lexically inherited from the surrounding scope at the time of definition.


### 7. JavaScript vs jQuery

- **JavaScript**: The core programming language of the web, capable of manipulating the DOM, handling events, and more.
- **jQuery**: A library built on JavaScript to simplify DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX. Modern JavaScript (ES6+) has made many jQuery features redundant.


### 8. Asynchronous programming

Allows code to perform long-running tasks (like network requests) without blocking the main thread. Achieved using:

- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to be called later.
- **Promises**: Objects representing future completion or failure.
- **async/await**: Syntactic sugar over Promises for cleaner, more readable async code.


### 9. Promises and async/await

- **Promise**: Represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.
  ```js
  fetch(url).then(res => res.json());
  ```
- **async/await**: Allows writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
  ```js
  async function getData() {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const data = await res.json();
  }
  ```
Promises help avoid "callback hell" and make error handling easier.


### 10. Closures

A **closure** is a function that "remembers" the variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after that scope has finished executing. This enables powerful patterns like data privacy and function factories.

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  }
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```


### 11. Prototypal Inheritance

JavaScript uses **prototypal inheritance**: objects inherit properties and methods from other objects via the `[[Prototype]]` chain.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;
}
```
All objects ultimately inherit from `Object.prototype`.


### 12. Memory Management

JavaScript uses **automatic garbage collection** (usually mark-and-sweep). The engine tracks object references; when an object is no longer reachable, it is removed from memory. Developers should avoid memory leaks by cleaning up timers, listeners, and unused references.


### 13. JavaScript Design Patterns

- **Module**: Encapsulate code in reusable, private units.
- **Observer**: Objects subscribe to events and get notified of changes.
- **Factory**: Functions that create and return objects.
- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of an object exists.

Patterns help organize code for scalability and maintainability.


### 14. Event Bubbling and Capturing

- **Bubbling**: Events propagate from the target element up to the root.
- **Capturing**: Events propagate from the root down to the target.

```js
element.addEventListener("click", handler, true); // capturing phase
element.addEventListener("click", handler, false); // bubbling phase (default)
```
Understanding these phases is key for advanced event handling.


### 15. Cross-browser Compatibility

Ensuring code works across browsers:

- Use **feature detection** (not browser detection).
- Use **polyfills** for missing features.
- Test in multiple browsers.
- Use tools like **Babel** (transpiles JS) and **Autoprefixer** (adds CSS prefixes).


### 16. null vs undefined

- `undefined`: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- `null`: An assignment value that represents "no value" or "empty".

```js
let a; // undefined
let b = null; // null
```


### 17. Hoisting

- **Variables declared with `var`** are hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.
- **`let` and `const`** are hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone).
- **Function declarations** are hoisted fully.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;
```


### 18. == vs ===

- `==`: Loose equality, performs type coercion.
- `===`: Strict equality, no type conversion.

```js
0 == '0' // true
0 === '0' // false
```
Prefer `===` for predictable comparisons.


### 19. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

The period between entering a block and variable declaration with `let`/`const`. Accessing the variable in the TDZ throws a `ReferenceError`.

```js
{
  // TDZ for x starts here
  let x = 10;
}
```


### 20. Event Delegation

A technique where a single event handler on a parent element manages events for all its children. Useful for dynamic lists.

```js
document.getElementById('list').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if(e.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    alert(e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```
Improves performance and simplifies code.


### 21. Web Workers

**Web Workers** run JavaScript in background threads, allowing heavy computations without blocking the UI.

```js
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage("start");
worker.onmessage = (e) => console.log(e.data);
```
Useful for CPU-intensive tasks.


### 22. Module Pattern

Encapsulates private and public members, often using IIFE or ES Modules.

```js
const Module = (function() {
  let privateVar = "secret";
  return {
    getSecret: () => privateVar
  };
})();
```
Helps organize code and prevent global namespace pollution.


### 23. Error Handling in async/await

Use `try/catch` blocks to handle errors in asynchronous code.

```js
try {
  const res = await fetch(url);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```
This makes async error handling straightforward and readable.


### 24. map vs forEach

- **`map`**: Transforms each element and returns a new array.
- **`forEach`**: Executes a function for each element, returns `undefined`.

```js
const doubled = [1,2,3].map(x => x * 2); // [2,4,6]
[1,2,3].forEach(x => console.log(x)); // prints 1,2,3
```


### 25. Garbage Collection

JavaScript automatically frees memory for objects that are no longer referenced. However, developers should:

- Remove unused event listeners.
- Clear timers and intervals.
- Avoid closures that capture unnecessary variables.

Memory leaks can still occur if references are unintentionally kept.

## React Interview Questions

### 1. Is React compiled or interpreted?

**Answer:**  
React is considered a **compiled** framework. Developers typically write React code using JSX (JavaScript XML), which is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML but is not natively understood by browsers. Before this code can run in the browser, it must be transformed into standard JavaScript. This transformation is handled by tools like **Babel** (for JSX to JS) and bundlers like **Webpack** or **Vite** (for module bundling and optimization). This compilation step allows developers to use modern JavaScript features and JSX, ensuring compatibility and performance in all browsers. The compiled output is what the browser actually executes.


### 2. What is Virtual DOM and how does it work?

**Answer:**  
The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. When a component’s state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one using a process called **diffing**. React then calculates the minimal set of changes needed and efficiently updates only those parts of the real DOM. This approach avoids direct, frequent manipulation of the DOM, which is slow, and instead batches updates for better performance. The Virtual DOM is a key reason why React apps feel fast and responsive, even with frequent UI updates.


### 3. Explain React lifecycle methods

**Answer:**  
**Lifecycle methods** are special functions in React **class components** that run at specific points in a component’s existence:

- **Mounting:**  
  - `constructor()`: Initializes state and binds methods.
  - `componentDidMount()`: Runs after the component is inserted into the DOM. Ideal for API calls, subscriptions, or setting up timers.
- **Updating:**  
  - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: Runs after updates to props or state. Useful for responding to changes or triggering side effects.
- **Unmounting:**  
  - `componentWillUnmount()`: Runs just before the component is removed from the DOM. Used for cleanup, like removing event listeners or cancelling network requests.

With **functional components**, similar behavior is achieved using the `useEffect` hook.


### 4. Class components vs Functional components

**Answer:**  
- **Class Components:**  
  - Use ES6 classes.
  - Manage state with `this.state` and update with `this.setState`.
  - Use lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, etc.).
  - More verbose and less favored in modern React.

- **Functional Components:**  
  - Are plain JavaScript functions.
  - Use **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) for state and side effects.
  - Simpler, easier to read, and now the standard for new React code.
  - Can do everything class components can, but with less boilerplate.


### 5. What are React Hooks?

**Answer:**  
**React Hooks** are special functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to manage state, perform side effects, and access context, which previously required class components. Common hooks include:

- `useState`: Adds local state to a function component.
- `useEffect`: Performs side effects (like data fetching, subscriptions).
- `useContext`: Accesses context values.
- `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and others for advanced scenarios.

Hooks make code more reusable and easier to test.


### 6. Explain useState and useEffect

**Answer:**  
- **`useState`**:  
  - Declares a state variable in a functional component.
  - Returns an array: the current state and a function to update it.
  - Example:
    ```js
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

- **`useEffect`**:  
  - Runs side effects after rendering (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, DOM updates).
  - Accepts a function and a dependency array.
  - Example:
    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
    }, [count]);
    ```
  - Runs after every render by default, or only when dependencies change.


### 7. What is Context API?

**Answer:**  
The **Context API** is a built-in React feature for sharing data (like user info, theme, or language) across the component tree without passing props manually at every level (avoiding "prop drilling"). You create a context with `React.createContext()`, provide a value with a `<Provider>`, and consume it with `useContext` or `<Consumer>`. It’s ideal for global data that many components need.


### 8. How to manage state in React?

**Answer:**  
- **Local state:**  
  - Use `useState` or `useReducer` for state that only one component or a small group of components needs.
- **Global state:**  
  - Use Context API for simple global data.
  - For complex state or large apps, use state management libraries like **Redux**, **Zustand**, or **Recoil**.
- **Server state:**  
  - Use libraries like **React Query** or **SWR** for caching and synchronizing server data.


### 9. What is prop drilling and how to avoid it?

**Answer:**  
**Prop drilling** occurs when you pass data through many layers of components just to reach a deeply nested child. This can make code harder to maintain and understand. To avoid prop drilling:

- Use the **Context API** to provide data globally.
- Use state management libraries (Redux, Zustand) for complex scenarios.
- Sometimes, restructuring components or lifting state up can help.


### 10. Explain React Router

**Answer:**  
**React Router** is a popular library for handling navigation and routing in React applications. It lets you define URL paths and map them to components, enabling single-page app (SPA) navigation without full page reloads. Key components:

- `<BrowserRouter>`: Wraps your app to enable routing.
- `<Routes>`: Groups route definitions.
- `<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />`: Maps a path to a component.
- `<Link to="/about">About</Link>`: Navigates between routes.

React Router supports nested routes, route parameters, redirects, and more.


### 11. What are Higher Order Components?

**Answer:**  
A **Higher Order Component (HOC)** is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced or additional functionality. HOCs are used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and cross-cutting concerns (like authentication, logging, or data fetching).

Example:
```js
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function(props) {
    console.log('Rendering', WrappedComponent.name);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
```
HOCs do not modify the original component but wrap it.


### 12. How to optimize React performance?

**Answer:**  
- Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components when props haven’t changed.
- Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations.
- Use `useCallback` to memoize functions passed as props.
- Lazy-load components with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` to split code and reduce initial bundle size.
- Avoid deeply nested component trees and unnecessary state updates.
- Use keys correctly in lists to help React identify changed elements.


### 13. What is Server Side Rendering (SSR)?

**Answer:**  
**Server Side Rendering (SSR)** is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the browser. This improves initial load performance and SEO, as search engines and users see content immediately. After the initial load, React takes over on the client (hydration). Frameworks like **Next.js** make SSR easy to implement in React apps.


### 14. Explain React's reconciliation process

**Answer:**  
**Reconciliation** is React’s process for updating the DOM efficiently. When state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one (diffing). It calculates the minimal set of changes and updates only those parts of the real DOM. This process is fast and avoids unnecessary DOM operations, which are expensive.


### 15. How to handle forms in React?

**Answer:**  
- Use state variables to store input values.
- Bind input values to state and update state on change.
- Handle form submission with an `onSubmit` handler.
- Example:
  ```js
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```
- For complex forms, consider libraries like **Formik** or **react-hook-form**.


### 16. What are Pure Components?

**Answer:**  
A **PureComponent** is a class component that implements a shallow comparison of props and state in `shouldComponentUpdate`. It only re-renders if props or state actually change, helping to avoid unnecessary renders. For functional components, `React.memo` provides similar optimization.


### 17. Explain React.memo() and when to use it

**Answer:**  
`React.memo` is a higher-order component for functional components. It memoizes the rendered output and only re-renders the component if its props change (using a shallow comparison). Use it to optimize performance for components that render the same output given the same props, especially in large lists or complex UIs.

Example:
```js
const MyComponent = React.memo(function(props) { ... });
```


### 18. What are Error Boundaries?

**Answer:**  
**Error Boundaries** are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app. They are implemented as class components using `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError`.

Example:
```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };
  static getDerivedStateFromError() { return { hasError: true }; }
  componentDidCatch(error, info) { /* log error */ }
  render() {
    return this.state.hasError ? <h1>Something went wrong.</h1> : this.props.children;
  }
}
```
Error boundaries do not catch errors in event handlers or async code.


### 19. How to implement code-splitting in React?

**Answer:**  
**Code-splitting** breaks your app into smaller bundles that are loaded on demand, improving performance. In React, use `React.lazy()` to dynamically import components and `<Suspense>` to show fallback UI while loading.

Example:
```js
const LazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComp'));
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <LazyComp />
</Suspense>
```
This loads `LazyComp` only when needed.


### 20. Explain useCallback and useMemo

**Answer:**  
- **`useCallback(fn, deps)`**: Returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if dependencies change. Useful for passing stable functions to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **`useMemo(fn, deps)`**: Returns a memoized value computed by the function, recalculated only when dependencies change. Useful for expensive calculations.

Example:
```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(a), [a]);
```


### 21. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

**Answer:**  
- **Controlled Components:**  
  - Form data is managed by React state.
  - Input value is set by state and updated via event handlers.
  - Enables validation, conditional logic, and programmatic control.
  - Example:
    ```js
    const [val, setVal] = useState('');
    <input value={val} onChange={e => setVal(e.target.value)} />
    ```

- **Uncontrolled Components:**  
  - Form data is managed by the DOM.
  - Use a `ref` to access the input’s value directly.
  - Less code for simple forms, but less control.
  - Example:
    ```js
    const inputRef = useRef();
    <input ref={inputRef} />
    // Access value: inputRef.current.value
    ```

**Summary:**  
Use controlled components for forms that need validation or dynamic behavior. Use uncontrolled components for simple or legacy forms where direct DOM access is sufficient.


### 22. How to handle API calls in React?

**Answer:**  
- Use `useEffect` to trigger API calls on component mount or when dependencies change.
- Use `fetch` or libraries like `axios` to make HTTP requests.
- Store the result in state and handle loading/error states.
- Example:
  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      const res = await fetch('/api/data');
      const data = await res.json();
      setData(data);
    }
    fetchData();
  }, []);
  ```
- For advanced needs, use libraries like **React Query** or **SWR** for caching and background updates.


### 23. Explain React.lazy() and Suspense

**Answer:**  
- **`React.lazy()`**: Lets you load components dynamically (on demand), enabling code-splitting.
- **`Suspense`**: Displays a fallback UI (like a spinner) while the lazy component is loading.

Example:
```js
const LazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComp'));
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <LazyComp />
</Suspense>
```
This improves performance by loading code only when needed.


### 24. Different ways to style React components

**Answer:**  
- **Plain CSS**: Import `.css` files and use class names.
- **CSS Modules**: Locally scoped CSS files (e.g., `styles.module.css`).
- **Styled-components**: Write CSS-in-JS using the `styled-components` library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Inline styles**: Pass a style object directly to the `style` prop, e.g., `<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>`.

Choose based on project needs and team preferences.


### 25. How to implement authentication in React?

**Answer:**  
1. User submits login form with credentials.
2. Frontend sends credentials to backend API.
3. Backend returns an authentication token (e.g., JWT).
4. Store the token in `localStorage` or an HTTP-only cookie.
5. For protected routes, check for the token before rendering.
6. Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

Example:
```js
<Route path="/dashboard" element={isAuth ? <Dashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" />} />
```
For advanced needs, use context or state management to track authentication status, and handle token refresh and logout securely.


## Git & Version Control - In-Depth Simplified Answers

### 1. **Can we use Git without GitHub?**

Yes. Git is a **local version control system**, while GitHub is just a remote platform to host Git repositories online. You can use Git entirely offline.

### 2. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

* **Git**: Tool to track changes in your code.
* **GitHub**: Website to share, collaborate, and store Git repositories.

### 3. **Where does Git store data?**

In a hidden folder named `.git` inside the project root. It stores commits, branches, logs, etc.


### 4. **What is `.gitignore` and its purpose?**

A file that tells Git which files/folders to **ignore** (not track). Common examples: `node_modules`, `env`, `log` files.


### 5. **Where are Git login credentials stored?**

They can be cached by Git Credential Manager, stored in:

* `.git-credentials`
* Credential helpers (e.g., Windows, macOS keychains)


### 6. **Explain Git commands: pull, push, fork, blame**

* `git pull`: Fetch + merge changes from remote.
* `git push`: Send local commits to remote.
* **Fork**: GitHub operation to clone someone else's repo to your account.
* `git blame`: Shows who made changes to each line in a file.


### 7. **What happens if you put a `.gitignore` file inside another `.gitignore`?**

`.gitignore` doesn’t ignore itself unless explicitly mentioned. Nesting `.gitignore` files in subfolders is allowed for modular ignores.


### 8. **Difference between `.git` and `.github` directory**

* `.git`: Contains Git internals.
* `.github`: Contains config files for GitHub like workflows, issue templates, PR templates.


### 9. **What is cherry-pick in Git?**

It applies a specific commit from one branch into another.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```


### 10. **How to handle merge conflicts?**

* Occurs when the same lines are edited differently in branches.
* Git marks conflicts in files.
* You must manually resolve them and then commit.


### 11. **What is Git rebase?**

It moves your branch to the tip of another branch and reapplies your commits.

```bash
git rebase main
```

Keeps history linear.


### 12. **Explain Git branching strategies**

* **Feature branch**: Separate branch per feature.

### 13. **What is Git stash?**

Temporarily saves changes without committing.

```bash
git stash
```


### 14. **How to revert commits?**

* To undo changes:

```bash
git revert <commit>
```

Creates a new commit to cancel the effects of a previous one.


### 15. **What is Git bisect?**

Used to find the commit that introduced a bug using binary search.

```bash
git bisect start
```


### 16. **What is Git squash and when to use it?**

Combines multiple commits into one.
Useful for cleaning history before merging a PR.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```


### 17. **Explain Git flow workflow**

A structured branching model:

* `main`: Production-ready
* `develop`: Development
* `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`: For features, releases, and patches


### 18. **Difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`**

* `git fetch`: Gets data but doesn’t merge.
* `git pull`: Fetch + auto merge into current branch.


### 19. **How to undo a git commit that has been pushed?**

* Use `revert` for safe undo:

```bash
git revert <commit>
```

* Or `reset` + force push (not recommended):

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push -f
```


### 20. **What is Git submodule?**

Used to include one Git repo inside another.

```bash
git submodule add <url>
```


### 21. **How to handle large files in Git?**
