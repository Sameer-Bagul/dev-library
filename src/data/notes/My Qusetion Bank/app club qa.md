6. **Replica sets:** Provide high availability and data redundancy by replicating data across multiple servers.
7. **Advantages of MongoDB:** Flexible schema, horizontal scalability, and fast writes.
8. **Transactions:** Use multi-document transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency.
9. **Data consistency:** Use replica sets and write concerns to ensure data reliability.
10. **Pagination:** Use the `skip()` and `limit()` methods or aggregation framework to paginate results.

### **Express.js**
1. **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests.
2. **Routes:** Defined using HTTP methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc., to handle different endpoints.
3. **Middleware:** Functions that execute during the request-response cycle, such as for logging or authentication.
4. **Error handling:** Use `next(err)` to pass errors to custom error-handling middleware.
5. **Routing parameters:** URL segments (e.g., `/user/:id`) that can be dynamically accessed.
6. **File uploads:** Use `multer` middleware to handle file uploads.
7. **Securing Express:** Use HTTPS, sanitize input, and implement authentication strategies like JWT.
8. **Authentication/authorization:** Use middleware to verify tokens or session data.
9. **HTTP status codes:** Common codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error).
10. **Logging:** Use `morgan` or custom middleware to log request data.

### **Basic Questions (1-10)**
1. **What is Machine Learning?**  
   ML is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms that allow systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.
