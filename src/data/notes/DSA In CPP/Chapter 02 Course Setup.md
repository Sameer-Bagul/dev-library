# Chapter 02: Course Setup for DSA with C++

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C++ programming
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms concepts

## Tools and Environment Setup

### 1. Install a C++ Compiler
- **Windows**: Install MinGW or Visual Studio
- **MacOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Linux**: Install GCC

### 2. Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Visual Studio Code**: Lightweight and customizable
- **CLion**: Powerful IDE from JetBrains
- **Code::Blocks**: Open-source and easy to use

### 3. Configure the IDE
- Set up the compiler path
- Configure build and debug settings

### 4. Version Control System
- Install Git for version control
- Set up a GitHub repository for your projects

### 5. Additional Tools
- **CMake**: For managing project builds
- **GDB**: For debugging

## Setting Up Your First Project

1. **Create a new project in your IDE**
2. **Write a simple "Hello, World!" program**
3. **Build and run the program to ensure everything is set up correctly**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Summary
- Ensure all tools and environments are properly set up
- Verify the setup by running a simple C++ program

## Next Steps
- Start with basic data structures like arrays and linked lists
- Gradually move to more complex algorithms and data structures
