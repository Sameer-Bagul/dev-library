## Regression

In this module, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of regression, including Linear, Non-linear, Simple, and Multiple regression techniques. You will explore their applications and implement these methods on two different datasets in the lab sessions. Additionally, you will learn how to evaluate regression models and measure their accuracy.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of regression.
- Explain simple linear regression.
- Explore approaches for evaluating regression models.
- Identify evaluation metrics for assessing the accuracy of regression models.
- Gain insights into multiple linear regression.
- Apply Simple and Multiple Linear Regression techniques to a dataset for estimation.
