### Ch 12 - useEffect Hook Detailed, API Calls

#### What is useEffect?
- `useEffect` is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components.
- It is similar to `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.
- It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs using dependencies.

#### What is a side effect?
- A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed.
- Examples of side effects include data fetching, setting up subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM.

#### Syntax
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    // side effect code here
}, [dependencies]);
```

#### What are dependencies?
- Dependencies are an array of values that the effect depends on.
- If any of the dependencies change, the effect will run again.
- If you want the effect to run only once, pass an empty array as the second argument.

#### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        const [text, setText] = useState('');

        useEffect(() => {
                console.log('Count has changed:', count);
        }, [count]); // This effect depends on the `count` state

        useEffect(() => {
                console.log('Text has changed:', text);
        }, [text]); // This effect depends on the `text` state

        return (
                <div>
                        <p>Count: {count}</p>
                        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
                        <p>Text: {text}</p>
                        <input type="text" value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
                </div>
        );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

#### What is the cleanup function?
- The cleanup function is a function that runs before the effect is re-run or when the component is unmounted.
- It is useful for cleaning up resources like subscriptions or timers.

#### Example
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
                console.log('Hello');
        }, 1000);

        return () => {
                clearInterval(interval);
        };
}, []);
```

#### What is the return value of useEffect?
- The return value of `useEffect` is a cleanup function that runs before the effect is re-run or when the component is unmounted.
- You can use this function to clean up resources like subscriptions or timers.

#### Example
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
                console.log('Hello');
        }, 1000);

        return () => {
                clearInterval(interval);
        };
}, []);
```

#### What is the effect of not passing dependencies?
- If you don't pass any dependencies to `useEffect`, the effect will run after every render.
- This can lead to performance issues if the effect is expensive or causes unnecessary re-renders.

#### What is a memory leak?
- A memory leak is a situation where a program uses more memory than it needs, leading to performance issues and crashes.
- Memory leaks can occur when resources are not properly cleaned up, like in the case of subscriptions or timers.

#### How to prevent memory leaks?
- To prevent memory leaks, make sure to clean up resources like subscriptions or timers in the cleanup function of `useEffect`.
- You can also use the `useEffect` hook with dependencies to control when the effect runs and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

#### What is the effect of not returning a cleanup function?
- If you don't return a cleanup function from `useEffect`, the effect will run after every render without cleaning up resources.
- This can lead to memory leaks and performance issues if the effect creates subscriptions or timers.

#### API Calls Using useEffect
- You can use the `useEffect` hook to make API calls in function components.
- You can fetch data from an API when the component mounts or when a dependency changes.

#### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const APIExampleComponent = () => {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
        const [error, setError] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
                const fetchData = async () => {
                        try {
                                const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
                                if (!response.ok) {
                                        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                                }
                                const result = await response.json();
                                setData(result);
                        } catch (error) {
                                setError(error);
                        } finally {
                                setLoading(false);
                        }
                };

                fetchData();
        }, []);

        if (loading) {
                return <p>Loading...</p>;
        }

        if (error) {
                return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
        }

        return (
                <div>
                        <h1>{data.title}</h1>
                        <p>{data.body}</p>
                </div>
        );
};

export default APIExampleComponent;
