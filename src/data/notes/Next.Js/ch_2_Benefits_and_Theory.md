    using this powerful IDE click the link in the description and try out webstorm today let me start with a very important first question what does nygs have that react doesn't in simple terms nextjs simplifies the development process and optimizes your applications it does that through its primary functionalities some of which you have to actively decide to use and others that you get out of the box just by switching to nextjs along with the course I've also prepare the ultimate next gsse book think of it as a

    
    05:57
    handbook that covers everything you need to know to become a Prof professional nextjs developer from the nextjs road map Concepts and features to Advanced tips and tricks for building scalable projects you can build and deploy to put on your portfolio it's a premium and paid ebook with over 200 pages but I've made it entirely free for the first 1,000 developers that downloaded clicking the link in the description so don't miss out the first of NEX gs's benefits is its architecture originally react had two types of components

    
    06:28
    functional and class-based components but now components are also categorized by where they run if a component runs in the user's browser it's called a client component and if it runs on the server it's called a server component this division was released in react 19 and although Frameworks Like Remix and asro also supported nextjs was the first to adopt it and fully utilize it since server components are more performant nextjs automatically converts every new component you create into a server

    
    06:57
    component unless you specifically instructed not to only if you need some browser functionalities but more on that later the second nextjs benefit is in the way it handles rendering while react 19 supports server components nextjs extends them to more advanced rendering strategies allowing you to choose exactly where and when they'll be rendered optimizing the performance even further first is client side rendering which happens on your browser the server sends a basic HTML document and JavaScript code which the browser

    
    07:26
    executes to render the components and display the website and the second is serers side rendering which involves rendering the web page on the server before transmitting it to your browser when you visit a page the server processes and renders the components on the server and sends back fully rendered HTML and JavaScript code to the client instantly displaying the website but why does this matter well on top of the fact that your website will load in 300 milliseconds and have page speed insights that look like this service

    
    07:54
    side rendering will significantly improve your website's search engine optimization client side rendering makes it almost impossible for search engines to crawl and index your websites as they're completely empty nextjs solves this issue by sending pre-rendered code giving Google plenty of stuff to rank us on the next big nextjs benefit is of course routing in react you need to install an additional react router package to create routes on the other hand nextjs doesn't require installing a separate routing package and uses a much

    
    08:24
    more intuitive approach to routing called file based routing each folder's name becomes a routes path for example a folder named about will create a new slab route super simple right and connecting directly to the routing system the next best thing about NEX GS is its Evolution from a simple frontend library to a full stack framework using the same file-based routing system I just described you can also create serverless functions to handle native backend API requests this means you can create an API endpoint by simply

    
    08:57
    creating a file called route. Js in a specific folder without needing to worry about the server infrastructure NEX GS takes care of scaling automatically and there are many other scaling features that NEX GS provides out of the box like automatic code splitting while code splitting in react is possible it requires manual configuration especially as the application grows next GS automates code splitting by default well what does that mean it means that when a user navigates to a different page only

    
    09:24
    the code for that page is loaded which significantly speeds up page load times pretty handy right but that was just one out of many built-in performance optimizations that NEX GS provides font optimization reduces layout shift improves loading Time by pre-loading font files and reduces Reliance on external services like Google fonts image optimization automatically compresses images and applies lazy loading CDN support and more script optimization optimizes even thirdparty scripts and all of these gr

    
    09:54
    optimizations come right out of the box with nextjs and it's not just performance nextjs is the definition of Cutting Edge it supports the latest features such as react compiler MDX file integration managing most SEO related tags analytics that run without blocking UI fast refresh server components hot module replacement and more oh I know that was a lot right if you want me to slow down a lot and provide you with a deeper understanding of all of these Concepts like architecture and rendering I'd highly recommend checking out the

    
    10:24
    ultimate nextjs course it covers all important Concepts spread out throughout many modules and individual ual lessons and more importantly it also includes active lessons which require you to actively apply what you've learned up to this point the ultimate next GS course has secured its place as the best nextjs course in the world and from today it just got updated to the latest nextjs version so check it out in the description with that said if you're not ready to get that course yet that's totally okay stay with me and I'll teach

    
    10:51
    you everything I know about next GS in this crash course to get started create a new empty folder on your desktop and open up your terminal once you're there run MPX create-- apppp add latest and press enter after that press y to install the installer and you'll be prompted to answer a couple of questions for the project name just type do slash because we're already in the folder within which we want to create our nygs app in this case say yes for typescript yes for eslint yes for tailin CSS in this case
