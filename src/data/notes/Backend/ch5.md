### Model View Controller (MVC) and File structure

#### How do you create functions for CRUD operations and use them in requests in Node.js?

To create functions for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Node.js, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up your project**: Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary packages.
2. **Create the server**: Set up an Express server.
3. **Define CRUD functions**: Write functions to handle each CRUD operation.
4. **Use the functions in routes**: Connect the functions to specific routes to handle incoming requests.

Here is an example code snippet demonstrating these steps:

```javascript
// Backend code for CRUD operations in Node.js using Express
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(morgan('default'));

// Read data from file
const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'data.json'), 'utf-8'));
const products = data.products;

// CRUD functions
const createProduct = (req, res) => {
    products.push(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(req.body);
};

const getAllProducts = (req, res) => {
    res.json(products);
};

const getProduct = (req, res) => {
    const id = +req.params.id;
    const product = products.find((p) => p.id === id);
    res.json(product);
};

const replaceProduct = (req, res) => {
    const id = +req.params.id;
    const productIndex = products.findIndex((p) => p.id === id);
    products.splice(productIndex, 1, { ...req.body, id: id });
    res.status(201).json();
};

const updateProduct = (req, res) => {
    const id = +req.params.id;
    const productIndex = products.findIndex((p) => p.id === id);
    const product = products[productIndex];
    products.splice(productIndex, 1, { ...product, ...req.body });
    res.status(201).json();
};

const deleteProduct = (req, res) => {
    const id = +req.params.id;
    const productIndex = products.findIndex((p) => p.id === id);
    const product = products[productIndex];
    products.splice(productIndex, 1);
    res.status(201).json(product);
};

// Routes
app.post('/products', createProduct);
app.get('/products', getAllProducts);
app.get('/products/:id', getProduct);
app.put('/products/:id', replaceProduct);
app.patch('/products/:id', updateProduct);
app.delete('/products/:id', deleteProduct);

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

In this example:
- The `createProduct` function handles creating new products.
- The `getAllProducts` function handles reading all products.
- The `getProduct` function handles reading a single product by ID.
- The `replaceProduct` function handles replacing a product by ID.
- The `updateProduct` function handles updating a product by ID.
- The `deleteProduct` function handles deleting a product by ID.

This setup allows you to perform CRUD operations using HTTP requests in a Node.js application.

#### What is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and how does it help in organizing code?

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. Each component has a specific role and responsibility:

1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database, processes data, and enforces business rules.
2. **View**: Represents the user interface of the application. It displays the data to the user and sends user input to the Controller.
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, interacts with the Model to retrieve data, and updates the View with the data.

The MVC architecture helps in organizing code by separating concerns and promoting a modular and maintainable codebase. Here are some benefits of using the MVC architecture:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a specific role, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.
- **Code reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Scalability**: The modular structure allows for easy scaling and adding new features.
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently, making it easier to write unit tests.
- **Collaboration**: Developers can work on different components simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

Overall, the MVC architecture provides a structured way to organize code, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale applications.
